Added support for handling attachments in Gram Elements with persistence. Persistence is achieved by uploading attachments to Gram servers and retrieving them as needed. Supported attachment formats include `text/*`, `image/*`, `application/pdf`, `application/json`, `application/x-yaml` / `application/yaml`.
