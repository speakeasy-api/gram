The first major wave of work for supporting MCP resources through functions includes creating the function_resource_definitions data model with corresponding indexes and resource_urns columns in toolset versions. It also introduces the function manifest schema for resources and implements deployment processing for function resources. A new resource URN type is added, which parses uniqueness from the URI as the primary key for resources in MCP. Additionally, this work enables adding and returning resources throughout the toolsets data model, preserves resources within toolset versions, and updates current toolset caching to account for them.
