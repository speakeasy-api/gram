All done! Jump in with `cd $DIR`.

Some next steps:

- Start a local development MCP server with `$PACKAGE_MANAGER run dev`

- Ensure the `Gram CLI` is installed and authenticated (`gram auth`): https://docs.getgram.ai/command-line/installation

- Build your function with `$PACKAGE_MANAGER run build`

- Create MCP servers from your tools in the Gram dashboard: https://app.getgram.ai
