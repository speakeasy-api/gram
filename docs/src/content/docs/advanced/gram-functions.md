This guide covers advanced topics for building robust, production-ready Gram Functions. For an introduction to Gram Functions, see the [Tool Sources](/concepts/tool-sources#gram-functions) documentation.

:::note[Work in Progress]
This guide is under development. Topics will be expanded with detailed examples and best practices.

## Error Handling

Effective error handling ensures AI agents receive meaningful feedback when operations fail.

### Basic error handling patterns

**TODO**: Cover common error scenarios and how to handle them:
- Input validation errors
- External API failures
- Network timeouts
- Authentication errors
- Rate limiting

### Error response formatting

**TODO**: Best practices for structuring error responses:
- Consistent error objects
- User-friendly error messages
- Including actionable next steps for the agent

### Retry strategies

**TODO**: When and how to implement retry logic:
- Exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers
- Identifying retryable vs non-retryable errors

## Local Development and Testing

Testing Functions locally before deployment saves time and catches issues early.

### Development environment setup

**TODO**: Setting up a local development environment:
- Installing dependencies
- Configuring environment variables locally
- Hot reloading during development

### Testing strategies

**TODO**: Approaches for testing Functions:
- Unit testing individual functions
- Integration testing with mock data
- Testing against real APIs in development
- Validating input schemas

### Debugging techniques

**TODO**: Tools and techniques for debugging:
- Logging best practices
- Using debuggers with Node.js
- Simulating MCP server behavior locally

## Deployment Workflow

Understanding the deployment lifecycle helps ensure smooth updates and rollbacks.

### Bundling and packaging

**TODO**: Preparing Functions for deployment:
- Optimizing bundle size (staying under the 700KB limit)
- Tree-shaking unused dependencies
- Minification strategies
- Handling environment-specific configurations

### Versioning strategies

**TODO**: Managing Function versions:
- Semantic versioning for Functions
- When to create new versions vs updating existing
- Testing new versions before promoting to production

### Monitoring and observability

**TODO**: Tracking Function performance in production:
- Logging execution time
- Monitoring error rates
- Alerting on failures
- Usage analytics

## Integration with Tool Curation

Functions work best when integrated into well-designed toolsets. See [Advanced Tool Curation](/build-mcp/advanced-tool-curation) for strategies on:
- Organizing Functions within toolsets
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Combining Functions with OpenAPI-based tools
- Creating workflow-oriented tool collections

## Best Practices

**TODO**: General guidelines for production Functions:
- Keeping Functions focused and single-purpose
- Avoiding blocking operations
- Managing state and side effects
- Security considerations (API keys, secrets management)
- Performance optimization
