Here you'll find detailed guides on how to quickly get connected to your Gram MCP servers in different ways.

Specifically we provide detailed instructions on:

* Connecting with GUI MCP Clients such as [Using Claude Desktop with Gram-hosted MCP servers](/clients/using-claude-desktop-with-gram-mcp-server).
* Connecting with CLI tools such as [Using Claude Code with Gram-hosted MCP servers](/clients/using-claude-code-with-gram-mcp-servers).
* Using MCP programmatically through APIs such as [Using OpenAI API with Gram-hosted MCP servers](/api-clients/using-openai-api-with-gram-mcp-servers).
* Building example applications like [Add AI chat to an existing app](/examples/adding-ai-chat-to-your-app).
