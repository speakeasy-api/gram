Claude Desktop is Anthropic's standalone AI assistant application that supports MCP through a JSON configuration file.

When combined with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers, Claude Desktop becomes even more powerful. Using MCP servers, you can give Claude access to your tools and infrastructure, allowing it to work with your APIs, databases, and other services.

This guide shows you how to connect Claude Desktop to a [Gram-hosted MCP server](https://www.speakeasy.com/blog/release-gram-beta) using Taskmaster, a full-stack CRUD application for task and project management. Taskmaster includes a web UI for managing projects and tasks, a built-in HTTP API, OAuth 2.0 authentication, and a Neon PostgreSQL database for storing data. Try the [demo app](https://taskmaster-speakeasyapi.vercel.app/) to see it in action.

You'll learn how to set up the connection, test it, and use natural language to manage tasks, projects, and workflows through Claude Desktop.

Find the full code and OpenAPI document in the [Taskmaster repository](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/taskmaster).

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need:

- A [Gram account](https://app.getgram.ai)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed

## Creating an MCP server

Before connecting Claude Desktop to a Taskmaster MCP server, you first need to create one. Follow our guide to [creating a Taskmaster MCP server](/examples/creating-taskmaster-mcp-server).

Once your Taskmaster MCP server is ready, there are two ways you can connect it to Claude Desktop:

- Use the MCP configuration file in Claude Desktop.
- Use the Claude Connectors feature to connect directly to your Gram-hosted MCP server.

## Connecting Claude Desktop to your Gram-hosted MCP server using the MCP configuration file

### 1. Access the Claude Desktop settings

In Claude Desktop, open settings:

- **macOS:** Go to **Claude -> Settings...** from the menu bar.
- **Windows:** Access settings through the application menu.

### 2. Open the MCP configuration

Select **Developer** from the left sidebar, then click **Edit Config**. This will create or open the MCP configuration file at:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### 3. Add the MCP server configuration

Add your Taskmaster MCP server configuration to the file.

- For **Pass-through Authentication**, the configuration looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "GramTaskmaster": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
              "mcp-remote",
              "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/your-taskmaster-slug",
              "--header",
              "MCP-TASKMASTER-API-KEY:<your-key-here>"
            ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- For a **Managed Authentication** server, the configuration looks like:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "GramTaskmaster": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/your-taskmaster-slug",
            "--header",
            "Authorization: ${GRAM_KEY}"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GRAM_KEY": "Bearer <your-gram-api-key>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Replace `your-taskmaster-slug` with your slug from your Taskmaster MCP server configuration and `<your-gram-api-key>` with your Gram API key.

### 4. Test the connection

Save the configuration file, then close Claude Desktop completely and reopen it. When the application has restarted, click the hamburger icon in the chat field to see the available tools.

Test the connection by asking:

```
Create a new task called "Test MCP connection" with description "Verify that the Taskmaster MCP server is working correctly"
```

Claude will use your Gram-hosted MCP server to create a task by calling the Taskmaster API.

## Connecting Claude Desktop to your Gram-hosted MCP server using Claude Connectors

Claude Connectors allow you to connect Claude Desktop to your Gram-hosted MCP server without manually editing the configuration file. This is more user-friendly, but comes with one important limitation: **Your MCP server must be public** and must not require environment variables.

If you need to use an authenticated server or an environment variable, you need to use the MCP configuration file method described above.

Here's how to set up a connection using Claude Connectors:

### 1. Access Claude Desktop settings

In Claude Desktop, open settings:

- **macOS:** Go to **Claude -> Settings...** from the menu bar.
- **Windows:** Access settings through the application menu.

### 2. Open the Connectors tab

Select **Connectors** from the left sidebar. This is where you can manage your connections to external services.

### 3. Add a custom connector

Click the **Add custom connector** button.

In the popup, provide the following information:

- **Name:** A descriptive name for your connector (for example, `Taskmaster MCP Server`).
- **URL:** The URL of your Gram-hosted MCP server (for example, `https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/your-slug`).

Claude Desktop may show a warning about trusting the server. Since this is your own MCP server, you can safely ignore this warning.

Click **Add** to create the connector.

### 4. Test the connection

There's no need to restart; you can test the connection immediately. In the chat, ask Claude something that requires the MCP server.

Claude should prompt you with a tool call request. This means the connection is working, and Claude can now use your Gram-hosted MCP server.

## Deciding which method to use

Both methods connect Claude Desktop to your Gram-hosted MCP server, but they have different use cases:

- **MCP configuration file:** Use this method if you need to connect to an authenticated MCP server or if you want more control over the configuration.
- **Claude Connectors:** Use this method for a simpler setup with public MCP servers. It's more user-friendly and doesn't require manual configuration file editing.

## Comparison of connection methods

| Attribute/Requirement          | MCP Configuration File | Claude Desktop Connectors |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Public MCP server              | ✅                      | ✅                         |
| Local MCP server               | ✅                      | ❌                         |
| Supports authenticated server  | ✅                      | ❌                         |
| Manual configuration needed    | ✅                      | ❌                         |
| User-friendly setup            | ❌                      | ✅                         |
| Supports passthrough variables | ✅                      | ❌                         |

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues:

- Verify the MCP server URL is correct in your configuration.
- Check that the API behind the MCP server is reachable from your machine.
- Ensure the `npx` command is available (reinstall Node.js if needed).
- Try restarting Claude Desktop after making configuration changes.
- For authenticated servers, verify your Gram API key in the dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.
