QUERY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It looks like the HubSpot MCP tool is not currently available in this session. The tool `mcp__big-40__hubspot_search_deals` that was listed in the environment appears to not be accessible.

To list HubSpot deals, you would need to:

1. Ensure the HubSpot MCP server is properly installed and configured
2. Verify the MCP server is running and connected
3. Check your HubSpot API credentials are set up correctly

Would you like help setting up the HubSpot MCP integration, or is there something else I can help you with?
