QUERY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The HubSpot MCP tool doesn't appear to be available or properly configured. To list HubSpot deals, you would need to:

1. Ensure the HubSpot MCP server is installed and configured
2. Check that your HubSpot API credentials are properly set up
3. Restart Claude Code if you just added the MCP server

Would you like help setting up the HubSpot MCP integration, or were you looking to interact with HubSpot data in a different way?
