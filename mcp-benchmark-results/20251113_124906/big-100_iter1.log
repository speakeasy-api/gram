QUERY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The HubSpot MCP tool doesn't appear to be available. This could mean:

1. The MCP server isn't currently running
2. The tool needs to be configured or connected
3. The integration may need to be set up

To use HubSpot functionality, you'll need to ensure the HubSpot MCP server is properly configured and running. You can check your MCP server configuration or set up the HubSpot integration if it hasn't been done yet.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
