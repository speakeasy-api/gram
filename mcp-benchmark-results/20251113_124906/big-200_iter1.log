QUERY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It looks like the HubSpot MCP tool isn't currently available in this session. The tool `mcp__big-40__hubspot_search_deals` that was listed in the context isn't accessible.

To list HubSpot deals, you would typically need to:
1. Ensure the HubSpot MCP server is properly configured and running
2. Have the necessary HubSpot API credentials set up
3. Connect the MCP server to this Claude Code session

Would you like help setting up the HubSpot MCP integration, or is there something else I can assist you with?
