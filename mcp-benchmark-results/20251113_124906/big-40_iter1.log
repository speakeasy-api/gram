It looks like the HubSpot MCP tool isn't currently available. The `mcp__big-40__hubspot_search_deals` tool that was listed in the approved tools may not be properly configured or connected.

To use HubSpot integration, you'll need to:
1. Ensure the MCP server is properly installed and configured
2. Check that the HubSpot MCP server is running
3. Verify your HubSpot API credentials are set up
