QUERY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MCP HubSpot tool doesn't appear to be available or properly configured in the current session. To list HubSpot deals, you would need to:

1. Ensure the HubSpot MCP server is installed and configured
2. Verify the MCP server is running and accessible
3. Check that proper authentication credentials are set up for HubSpot API access

Would you like help setting up the HubSpot MCP integration, or would you prefer to interact with HubSpot through their REST API directly?
