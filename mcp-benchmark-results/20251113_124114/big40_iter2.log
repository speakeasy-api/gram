QUERY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The HubSpot MCP tool doesn't appear to be available or properly configured. The `mcp__big-40__hubspot_search_deals` tool that was listed in the approved tools isn't accessible.

To list HubSpot deals, you'll need to:

1. Check if the HubSpot MCP server is properly installed and configured
2. Verify the MCP server is running and connected
3. Ensure you have the necessary HubSpot API credentials configured

You can check your MCP configuration in Claude Code's settings or by running `/help` to see available MCP tools.
