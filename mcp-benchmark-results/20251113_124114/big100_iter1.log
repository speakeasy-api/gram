QUERY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It appears the HubSpot MCP tool isn't currently available or properly configured. The tool `mcp__big-40__hubspot_search_deals` that was mentioned in the environment isn't accessible.

To list HubSpot deals, you would typically need to:

1. Ensure the HubSpot MCP server is properly configured and running
2. Verify the MCP server connection in your Claude Code settings
3. Check that the HubSpot API credentials are properly set up

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot the MCP server configuration, or would you prefer to access HubSpot deals through another method (like using the HubSpot API directly)?
