QUERY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to use the MCP tool directly rather than through Bash. However, I don't see the `mcp__big-40__hubspot_search_deals` tool available in my tool list. The tool appears in the auto-approval list but isn't available for direct invocation.

Based on the environment information, it seems you have an MCP server configured for HubSpot integration, but I'm unable to access it directly. This could be due to:

1. The MCP server not being properly connected to this session
2. The tool not being exposed to the Claude Code interface
3. Configuration issues with the MCP integration

To troubleshoot this, you might want to:
- Check your MCP server configuration
- Verify the HubSpot MCP server is running and accessible
- Review the Claude Code MCP integration settings

Would you like help with any of these troubleshooting steps?
