## React & Frontend Coding Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- Use the `pnpm` package manager
- When interacting with the server, prefer the `@gram/sdk` package (sourced from workspace at `./client/sdk`)
- The document `client/sdk/REACT_QUERY.md` is very helpful for understanding how to use React Query hooks that come with the SDK.
- For data fetching and server state, use `@tanstack/react-query` instead of manual `useEffect`/`useState` patterns
- When invalidating React Query caches after mutations, invalidate ALL relevant query keys — not just the most specific one. Different hooks may use different query key prefixes for the same data (e.g., `queryKeyInstance` vs `toolsets.getBySlug`). Use broad invalidation helpers like `invalidateAllToolset(queryClient)` to ensure all consumers refresh.

### Styling and Design System

- **ALWAYS use Moonshine design system utilities** from `@speakeasy-api/moonshine` instead of hardcoded Tailwind color values
- **NEVER use hardcoded Tailwind colors** like `bg-neutral-100`, `border-gray-200`, `text-gray-500`, etc.
