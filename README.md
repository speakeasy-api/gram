# Gram

Gram is the tool platform for AI agents.

## Development

Run `./zero` until it succeeds. This script is what you will use to run the infra and services for local development. It will also handle installing dependencies and running pending database migrations before starting everything up.

The main dependencies for this project are Mise and Docker. The `./zero` script will guide you to install these if they are not found.

## Coding guidelines

All coding guidelines are written out in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md). Please make sure you read these before contributing to this project.

## Putting up pull requests

You must have a good title and description for your PR. Please do not be lazy about this or write it off as trivial. Go nuts with streams of commits but invest the 5 minutes to present a reviewable PR with good context. This is a non-negotiable.
